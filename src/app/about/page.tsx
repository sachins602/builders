        <strong>Our Missing Middle</strong> is a proof-of-concept web application designed to help visualize and explore <em>medium density housing</em> options in low-rise neighborhoods using AI-powered image manipulation.
      </p>

      <p>
        This tool is intended for municipal governments to deploy and for community members to use. When deployed, it can be customized to match the design language and planning context of individual municipalities, integrating with their APIs to reflect local zoning, architectural guidelines, and community needs.

        Purpose
      </h2>
      <p>
        Our goal is to make it easier to imagine and share alternative housing forms; <em>Our Missing Middle</em> supports more inclusive, community-driven conversations about urban density and design. This app is <em>not the solution</em> to the affordable housing crisisâ€”but it is <em>part of the solution</em>.
      </p>

        What is Missing Middle Housing?
      </h2>
      <p className="flex justify-center">

      </p>
      <p>
        Missing middle housing refers to a range of multi-unit or clustered housing types that are compatible in scale with single-family homes. These include duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes, townhouses, and small apartment buildings. They provide a middle ground between single-family homes and larger apartment complexes, offering more affordable and diverse housing options.

        Tackling NIMBYism

      </p>
      <p>
        One of the biggest challenges in implementing medium density housing is overcoming NIMBYism (Not In My Backyard). This app aims to address this by allowing users to visualize how these housing types would look in their neighborhoods, helping to alleviate concerns and foster acceptance.
